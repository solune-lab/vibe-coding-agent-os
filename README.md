✨ **Unlock 10x AI efficiency.** ✨ **Zero Vercel tax.** ✨ **100% Edge-ready.**

> "Now that I’m using the most expensive Opus 4.6, I actually feel like I have more quota than I did with Sonnet 4.5."

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. Copy the content of `vibe-coding-rules.md`.
2. **For Claude Code**: Place it in your project root.
3. **For Cursor/Windsurf**: Add it to your `.cursorrules` or Project Settings.
4. Watch your agent follow strict verification gates before every delivery.

I built this system to solve my own **"Development Constipation."**

I’m a Vibe Coder, and I’m extremely frugal with my AI quota—which also makes me very anxious. In the past, when I used natural language to give instructions, I constantly ran into bizarre situations.

For example: I just wanted to move two components closer together and reduce the white space. It was such a simple instruction. Yet, even using the most powerful coding models, the UI wouldn't budge after 5 or 6 attempts. Worse, it would randomly mess up the shapes of my components, leaving me with a pile of "spaghetti code."

This communication gap led to more and more unexpected bugs, vanishing my quota in less than 30 minutes due to endless, pointless revisions. It was beyond belief.

This pipeline isn't about showing off. It’s a **survival kit** I organized to stay within my budget limits. It turned my messy thoughts into a smooth, stable development process and cured my anxiety about token consumption. (True story.)

## 🚀 Compatibility: Works with ALL AI Tools
This system is **completely Tool-Agnostic**. While it delivers 10x efficiency for **Claude Code**, the MD rules and logic puzzles work flawlessly with **EVERY AI coding tool**, including:
* **Cursor / Windsurf / Trae**
* **Bolt.new / Lovable / Replit**
* **GitHub Copilot / Codex**
* **Any AI Agent** that accepts custom instructions or project context.

It’s about the **Logic**, not just the tool.

## 🧠 A. Brain: Vibe Coding Rules
This is the soul of the entire process. It elevates the AI Agent from a "chatbot" to a self-aware **"Senior Engineer"** with full autonomous authority.

### 🚧 5 Mandatory Delivery Gates
* **Root Cause Analysis**: Before any fix, the AI must answer 3 critical questions: Root cause, Reproduction conditions, and Regression risk. No blind patching allowed.
* **Autonomous Obstacle Handling**: The AI must proactively resolve environment blockers (e.g., executing `pkill` to reset stale processes) instead of skipping steps or asking for help.
* **No Screenshot, No Delivery**: Every UI modification requires a mandatory **Playwright** End-to-End test with a formal Verification Report and visual proof.

### 🧩 Glue Code Automation & Retrieval
* **Local Library Priority**: Before writing new code, the AI must scan `.specify/memory/glue-library/` to match existing "puzzle pieces". Reusing verified modules is mandatory to ensure stability and save tokens.
* **Smart Storage Rules**: After development, the AI automatically evaluates if the code has cross-project value. If it passes the "3-project reuse" criteria, it is extracted into a generic template for future use.

### ⚡ Infrastructure & Deployment Authority
* **Infrastructure Agent**: The AI autonomously analyzes requirements (e.g., Auth, Payments) and configures the necessary stack (Supabase, Stripe, etc.) without waiting for permission.
* **Zero-Manual Secret Syncing**: Automatically scans `.env` files and syncs secrets to the cloud environment, eliminating the need for manual copy-pasting.
* **SEO-Optimized Subdirectory Deployment**: Configures a Cloudflare Worker reverse proxy to deploy tools on high-authority subdirectories (e.g., `soluneai.com/tool-name`) for maximum SEO impact.

### 📈 10x Token Efficiency & Project Locking
* **Project Status Tracking (`PROJECT-STATUS.md`)**: The AI maintains a strict status board, locking completed PRD chapters. This prevents "memory loss" between sessions.
* **The "Opus Effect"**: Since implementing this methodology, using the premium **Opus 4.6** model actually consumes less quota than **Sonnet 4.5** did previously without it.

## 👄 C. Mouth: Vibe To Soec
[Try Tool Now](https://soluneai.com/vibe-to-spec)

**The Problem**: Humans speak in "vibes," but AI operates on "logic." When you say "make this look better," AI often guesses blindly.

* **Communication Bridge**: Translates your natural language into precise, industrial-grade AI instructions with built-in coordinate offsets and scope locking.
* **Surgical Precision**: Ensures the AI only modifies the specific components you intended, strictly preventing unintended side effects or broken styles in other areas.

## 🏗️ D. Body: PRD Master [⌛ 80%]
**The Problem**: Starting without a plan is a developer's nightmare. Without structured guidance, AI Agents easily lose track in long conversations.

* **Conversational Architect**: Gathers your scattered ideas through interactive chat and transforms them into a professional, structured PRD.
* **Visual Logic with Mermaid**: Automatically generates **Mermaid flowcharts** to visualize complex user journeys and system logic.
* **Modular Chaptering**: Breaks down your project into "locked" chapters based on the **Vibe Coding Rules**, allowing AI Agents to build your tool chapter-by-chapter with zero friction.
* **Built-in Security DNA**: Pre-integrates essential frameworks like **Device Fingerprinting** and anti-abuse logic directly into the design phase.

## 👁️ E. Eyes: Auto Money Flow [⌛ 80%]
**The Problem**: Stops developers from **"building in a vacuum."** * **End-to-End Profitability Path**: Provides a complete roadmap covering market research, feature planning, pricing strategies, and marketing copy.
* **Market-Driven Recommendations**: Analyzes your technical stack to recommend high-demand tools that are actually viable.
* **Scientific Pricing Strategy**: Incorporates pricing psychology to maximize conversions (e.g., **Integer pricing** for professional tools to build trust, or **.99 endings** for entertainment-oriented tools).
* **No More "Self-Amusement"**: Ensures every line of code you write is directed toward a verified market need.
