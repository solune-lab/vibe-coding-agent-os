# 🤖 Vibe Coding Agent OS 

> **Evolutionary MD Rules to transform AI Agents from "code generators" into "Senior Engineers."**

This is a specialized set of Instruction Specifications (MD Rules) designed for the **Vibe Coding** era. It eliminates the common pain point of AI generating incompatible, untested, or "junk" code.

## 🗺️ Roadmap (The Vibe Coding Ecosystem)

We are building a complete workflow to turn raw ideas into production-ready apps on Cloudflare.

- [x] **Phase 1: Brain (The MD Rules)** - High-quality instructions for AI Agents. (Released!)
- [x] **Phase 2: Hand (Vibe Coding Translator)** - Natural language to Pro-Prompt tool. [Try Tool Now](https://solune.ai)
- [ ] **Phase 3: Feet (PRD Master)** - Automated logic & Next.js architecture generator. (Target: Q2 2026)
- [ ] **Phase 4: Compass (AutoMoney Flow)** - Monetization & Marketing Blueprint generator. (Planned)
- [ ] **Phase 5: The Puzzle Box** - 100+ Verified "Glue Code" templates optimized for Cloudflare. (Developing)

## 🔥 Why This Specification?

Most AI instructions only tell the AI *what* to do, but not *how to ensure it’s done right*. This OS integrates:

* **Pre-Delivery Verification**: Forces automated UI testing via Playwright. No screenshot, no delivery.
* **Cloudflare Edge Optimized**: Strict filtering of Node.js modules to ensure 100% deployment success.
* **Puzzle-Based Development**: Prioritizes verified "Glue Code" fragments to save 70% of tokens.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  Copy the content of `AI-Agent-Rules.md` into your Cursor/Claude/GPT system settings.
2.  Use it alongside your `.specify/memory/glue-library/`.
3.  **Need more speed?** Use the [Vibe Coding Translator](https://solune.ai) to generate professional prompts in one click.
